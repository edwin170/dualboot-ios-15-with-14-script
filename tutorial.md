# How do I dualboot?

1. Clone the repository with the following command: <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/dualra1n/dualra1n</code>.

2. Download the .iPSW file for the iOS version you intend to be dualbooting, and place it in the ipsw/ directory. The file can be obtained from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me). Please keep in mind that only iOS 13.6 to iOS 15.* are supported.

3. Execute the command `./dualboot.sh --dualboot (iOSver)`, replacing "(iOSver)" with the desired iOS version for dualbooting.

4. To switch to the dualbooted iOS version after your device rebooted, run <code>./dualboot.sh --boot</code>.

# How do I Jailbreak the Dualbooted iOS?

- Run `./dualboot.sh --jailbreak (iOSver)`. Upon completion, open the dualra1n-loader and click on "jailbreak". If your device reboots, simply select "re-jailbreak". (This method is highly recommended over Taurine.)

- To jailbreak with Taurine, use the command <code>./dualboot.sh --jailbreak (iOSver) --taurine </code>. After the process is completed, open the Apple TV app, select "install trollstore", and after a respring, open Taurine and select "jailbreak". If your device shows a blue screen, try a forced reboot. After rebooting, boot again into the second iOS version. If the Sileo app is not visible, retry the Taurine jailbreak. If Sileo is visible, the jailbreak was successful, and you can open dualra1n-loader and click "re-jailbreak" to activate the tweaks.

# How do I delete the dualbooted iOS?

1. To delete the dualbooted iOS, use the command: <code>./dualboot.sh --restorerootfs (iOSver) </code>. If you are using palera1n semi-tethered, you must add <code>--jail-palera1n</code> to the command.

2. If you wish to remove the jailbreak alone, use the "restorerootfs" option in the dualra1n-loader. After rebooting and running --boot, if the device doesn't boot and you previously ran --jailbreak, you need to jailbreak again to boot the secondary iOS version.

# Known issues 

 - "Deep Sleep": The device doesn't "wake up" after you turn it off. This can be fixed using "fixdeepsleep" option in the dualra1n-loader app, or by installing the [Fiona](https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/repository/julioverne-s-repo/package/com.julioverne.fiona/)

# Command Explanation :

- `--dualboot (vers) --dont-create-part`, used just to creating the boot files (and can fix some stuff if the device doesn't boot) instead of completely reinstalling the second ios again.

- `--dualboot (vers) --jail-palera1n`, use `--jail-palera1n` always when you have the palera1n semi-tethered jailbreak.

- `--downgrade (vers)`, use this if you don't have enough storage and you are positive that you dont have any important data on the main OS

- You can see all commands and their usage by running `./dualboot.sh --help`


# some error fixes

1. Ã— This environment is externally managed error python, on linux.
1: sudo rm /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED. not sure but you should change python3.11 to your python version. (Not Recomended , it can break your package manager)

2. if it is stuck on creating ramdisk, please force reboot your device and try again because bad dfu state
